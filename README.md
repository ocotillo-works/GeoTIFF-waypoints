# GeoTIFF-waypoints
Open a GeoTIFF image, click to add mission waypoints, then export your plan.


## TODO
- [x] Zoom/enhance visual size of tif
- [x] Number the waypoints
- [x] Draw lines between waypoints
- [ ] Export plan to a file to use in Mission Planner

### Usability & Quality of Life
- [ ] Input GeoTIFFs exceed GitHub 100MB input file size limit. Might need LFS.
- [ ] Script to set up requirements, environment.
